# sklearn.datasets.___
In this repo I'll use only sklearn.datasets package to build ML projects.
Reference -> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html
<br>
<br>
Scikit-learn makes available a host of datasets for testing learning algorithms. They come in three flavors:
<br>
Packaged Data: these small datasets are packaged with the scikit-learn installation, and can be downloaded using the tools in sklearn.datasets.load_*
<br>
Downloadable Data: these larger datasets are available for download, and scikit-learn includes tools which streamline this process. These tools can be found in sklearn.datasets.fetch_*
<br>
Generated Data: there are several datasets which are generated from models based on a random seed. These are available in the sklearn.datasets.make_*
